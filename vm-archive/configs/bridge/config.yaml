# Openpilot Serial Bridge Configuration

# Serial port settings
serial_port: /dev/ttyUSB0 # ESP32 device path (Linux: /dev/ttyUSBx, /dev/ttyACMx)
baud_rate: 115200 # Match ESP32 firmware
mock_mode: true # Set to true to run without hardware (simulation mode)

# PWM scaling
pwm_scale: 150 # Multiplier: steer [-1..1] -> PWM [-150..150]
pwm_cap: 255 # Absolute max PWM value (safety limit)

# Update rate
stream_hz: 20 # Bridge update frequency (10-50 Hz recommended)

# Openpilot connection (optional)
# openpilot_host: 192.168.43.1  # Uncomment to connect to remote openpilot (e.g., comma device)
# Leave commented for local openpilot on same machine

# Notes:
# - Tune pwm_scale to match desired steering authority
# - Lower values = gentler steering, higher = more aggressive
# - Start conservative (100-150) and increase as needed
# - pwm_cap is a hard safety limit enforced by both bridge and firmware
